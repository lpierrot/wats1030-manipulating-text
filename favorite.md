I find Nano to be my favorite editor by far. It is easy and simple to use. I was having some troubles when I was going through Lynda.com videos and for some reason 
I found a difficult to understand. The video and the instructons that were posted on Canvas made it easier for me to understand. This link 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAjRfJQF0Rc) was particularly helpful creating files. I tried to use EMACS and VI and their command lines require more attention.
